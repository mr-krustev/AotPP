Adventures of the Programmer Python

I am using this game project as a studying and practicing tool to learn and implement python solutions.

##Action plan

* Create a basic game that has some interactions between objects:
  * Enemies
    * Non-AI
    * AI
  * Player
    * Movement
    * Combat
    * Inventory
    * Quest Log
  * Quests
  * Achievements
*Some of these will come on a later stage*
* Implement OOP principles.
* Implement design patterns (Memento/Chain of Responsibility/etc)
* Implement non-console GUI
  * Add sprites and pictures
  * Add a GUI.
* Create an installer for the product.
* Multiplayer (networking?)
