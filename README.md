Adventures of the Programmer Python

I am using this game project as a studying and practicing tool to learn and implement python solutions.

##Action plan

1. Create a basic game that has some interactions between objects:
1.1 Enemies
1.1.1 Non-AI
1.1.2 AI
1.2 Player
1.2.1 Movement
1.2.2 Combat
1.2.3 Inventory
1.2.4 Quest Log
1.3 Quests
1.4 Achievements
*Some of these will come on a later stage*
2. Implement OOP principles.
3. Implement design patterns (Memento/Chain of Responsibility/etc)
4. Implement non-console GUI
4.1 Add sprites and pictures
4.2 Add a GUI.
5. Create an installer for the product.
